# Bootstrap-portfolio
I designed a personal portfolio using Bootstrap from scratch.

## Acceptance criteria
As a developer I want the following to happen when the page is loaded

-  When one of the links in the navigation is clicked the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

-  When viewing the section about my work the section contains titled images of my applications

-  When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
